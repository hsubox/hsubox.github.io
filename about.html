<div class="description centered">
	<p>
		I'm currently at the Recurse Center learning about what interests me. So far, it has been a combination of Javascript libraries (jQuery, React, Redux, React Native, D3, etc.), algorithms and data structures, and pair programming on anything and everything that sounds interesting.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before RC, I was working as a Process Engineer at 3M Company making "sand" for sandpaper. My degree was in bio-chemical engineering. However, I've always been interested in code and learned how to program on my own (and still learning). Ultimately, I decided to transition to a career in software development.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm looking for a role where I can make meaningful software. I value an environment that is technically challenging and collaborating with knowledgeable developers who can help me grow as a developer.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I'm not busy with that, I love to sail and bike. One day, I hope to circumnavigate the world on my currently-ficticious sailboat. Then do it again on my bicycle.
