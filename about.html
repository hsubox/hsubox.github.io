<p class="centered italic">Software Developer <span class="large">&amp;</span> Engineer</p>
<div class="description centered">
	<p>
		I'm currently at Dropbox, as a Software Engineer on the Growth team. I build experiences that delight customers and increase revenue, including no credit card trials and trial extensions.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the Recurse Center, I focused my learning on a combination of Javascript libraries (jQuery, React, Redux, React Native, D3, etc.), algorithms and data structures, and pair programming on anything and everything that sounds interesting.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before RC, I was working as a Process Engineer at 3M Company making "sand" for sandpaper. My degree was in bio-chemical engineering. However, I've always been interested in code and learned how to program on my own (and still learning). Ultimately, I decided to transition to a career in software development.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm looking for a role where I can make meaningful software. I value an environment that is technically challenging and collaborating with knowledgeable engineers who can help me grow as a engineer.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I'm not busy with that, I love to sail and bike. One day, I hope to circumnavigate the world on my currently-ficticious sailboat. Then do it again on my bicycle.
