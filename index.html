    <h2 class="centered">Hi, I'm Jennifer.</h2>
    <p class="centered italic">Software Developer <span class="large">&amp;</span> Engineer</p>
    <div class="description centered">
        <p>
            I'm currently on the Growth team at <span class="bold">Dropbox</span> building experiences that delight customers and increase revenue, including no credit card trials and trial extensions.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the <span class="bold">Recurse Center</span>, I focused my learning on a combination of Javascript libraries (jQuery, React, Redux, React Native, D3, etc.), algorithms and data structures, and pair programming on anything and everything that sounds interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before that, I was working as a Process Engineer at <span class="bold">3M Company</span> making "sand" for sandpaper as I had studied bio-chemical engineering at <span class="bold">MIT</span>. However, I've always been interested in code and learned how to program on my own (and still learning). Ultimately, I decided to transition to a career in software development.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm looking for a role where I can make meaningful software. I value an environment that is technically challenging and collaborating with knowledgeable engineers who can help me grow as a engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not busy with that, I love to sail and bike. One day, I hope to circumnavigate the world on my currently-ficticious sailboat. Then do it again on my bicycle.
