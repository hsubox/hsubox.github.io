Walking around campus, people often say _à tout_ to each other - that's short for _à tout à l'heure_ (see you a few hours, literally). If you won't see them later that day, you can instead use _à plus_ - which is short for _à plus tard_. It's confusing to non-natives French speakers like me - considering I finally picked up on this nuisance recently. At the end of a message, they often write "a+". A friend here asked me if we did the same, and my response was "a+ is a grade."
