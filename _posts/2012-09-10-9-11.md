When I first saw this banner, I could only read the simple words on top: 9/11. As an American, I immediately associated it with the terrorists attacks back home now over a decade ago...

However, for the students here, it means something different. The government has tried to push for increased 'National Education' that the students believe to be brainwashing. The Hong Kong students feel a separate political identity that lies more with democracy than the communism imposed by mainland China. Therefore, this curriculum pushed by the Communist regime feels to be propaganda to this distinct set of people.

Regardless I don't have classes tomorrow because of my schedule!
