Not much time to write, but I wanted to share a few first impressions of classes:

- It was really weird that students would talk among themselves during the entire lecture, so much so that I have to sit in the first 2-3 rows to hear. I'm not sure if it is culturally accepted, but it seems rather rude.
- All of my professors are of Chinese background. Their English is pretty good, but usually they speak at a rate much slower than back in the US. That means we fit less material in the same amount of class time.
- I'm not sure whether I should take this term really light or add a class, because at my course load right now, I have A LOT of free time.
