I have to say that it feels good to be home. I have quite a collection of places that have been home and will always be part of my identity, but nothing like the real deal. Home is a place you create, and sometimes it takes wandering the world for a year to know that.
I just wanted to thank my family, MIT, the Gilman International Scholarship, and EPFL for making this financially possible; and my family (again), friends both at home and those I've made abroad, and co-workers who got me through this year. I have really enjoyed blogging here, and all of you readers and commenters have kept me going. If anyone has any questions or is in need of advice about studying abroad, feel free to comment here, and I will do my best to answer in a timely manner.

Cheers!
