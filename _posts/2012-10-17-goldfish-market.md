Do you know how most cities have a few attractions that make it unique? Like "the bean" (Cloudgate) for Chicago, or the Eiffel Tower for Paris. Well, the things that make Hong Kong unique just don't seem to end.

Yesterday, I went to the goldfish market. It literally is a street in Mong Kok that sells goldfish and other animals: cats, dogs, hamsters, snakes, you name it. Also, instead of keeping the fish in a typical tank, they put them individually in plastic baggies, ready to take home! On a nearby street, there is also the bird market (where they sell pet birds and fake ones) and a flower market (where they sell plants). It is a great place for the photography-obsessed. I'm going to have to go back and bring my camera.
