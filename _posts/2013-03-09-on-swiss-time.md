When I first arrived in Switzerland, I was extremely careful to be punctual. I showed up to class 5 minutes before the hour (only to find that classes actually started 15 minutes past the hour). I still feel particularly bad when I am late. It's also hard to lose the 5 minutes margin I hold myself to in the US.

However, since being here, I have grown so accustomed to the trains being on time. I know exactly what time I need to leave my apartment to get to campus on time. The trains are always punctual. If they are more than 2 minutes behind, it is recorded as late, whereas a 15 minute train or bus is typical back home. The precision makes planning trips easy, knowing that I can make that 7 minute connection. It's really efficient for everyone involved.
