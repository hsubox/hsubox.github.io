There's the exams (last one is tomorrow!), and there are the goodbyes. It hasn't really hit me yet though, but I'm starting to goodbye to all my friends here. I don't know when the next time I will see any of them again... it might even be 10+ years. Scary. I hate farewells. However, it's also wonderful that as I am saying goodbye, I'm realizing how much I've become a 'local.' A part of my identity is here now. I am a Hong Konger.

Clich√©, I know :)
