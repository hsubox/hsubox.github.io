I found this great tumblr site with memes relevant to American Expats in Hong Kong: [http://cantomemes.tumblr.com/](http://cantomemes.tumblr.com/)

Maybe you will find them funny, or maybe not. (I'm starting to think like a Hong Kong-er!) But they might give you some less serious insight into the life here.

One theme that is harder to pick up on is the maid ("domestic helper") system in Hong Kong. The maids are typically of Philippine or Indonesian background. They come here for better pay, which they send home to their husbands/children back home. However, Hong Kong doesn't really have labor laws, and many of these maids get paid the equivalent of maybe ~$500USD a month. And with that, they are expected to do household chores, endure yelling for any wrongdoings, and sometimes (apparently) sleep on the floor.
