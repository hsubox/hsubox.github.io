If you own a smartphone, unlock it before you leave! (That is if it is legal.) I don't use a data plan abroad since it is costly, but the pre-downloaded maps and locally-stored resources can be super handy. These apps and accompanying websites will make trip planning and exploring easier.

The offline maps feature on the [Google Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps) makes sure you won't get lost. I personally star the places I want to visit and remove them when I'm done.

[Trip Advisor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripadvisor.tripadvisor) has city guides so you remember the long list of top attractions. The website has great reviews, helping you narrow that down.

[Wikisherpa](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kiwix.kiwixcustomwikivoyage) allows you to download a local copy of the Wikitravel page for your destination. Sometimes, it doesn't capture all the sub-points, but is great overall.

[Triposo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.triposo.droidguide.world) can also be a great cached guidebook.

You can plan stops on [Tripomatic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripomatic) (Android version yet to be released), and it will help you find a route to hit those attractions efficiently. They have good data for major cities, but smaller ones, this might not be a good option.

For traveling around Europe, [Rail planner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.eurail) lets you find a train to use with your Eurail pass or just to get from point A to B if you aren't sure how.

Also check the destination's tourism website. For example, Switzerland offers [City Guides](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myswitzerland.cityguide.zuerich) for popular places.

If you do have access to a data plan, there are even more resources at your fingertips. With [Yelp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yelp.android) (in the US) and [Open Rice](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openrice.android) (in Hong Kong), I was never disappointed eating out. I need to find a suitable equivalent in Switzerland.

There are also some less-travel related gems I want to share.
[Google Sky Map](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid) is fun for evenings out. My friends love looking for constellations on a clear night with this app.

I use [Dropbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dropbox.android) to sync my phone's photos with my computer. That way, I don't need to transfer them manually; they'll magically appear on my computer once I have Wi-fi.

And if you know of a good offline or image translating app, I would love to know about it.
