I went out to dinner last night with some of the other exchange students. One of them pointed out: "Watch, they are only going to give us one menu!" Between the group of 8, we all were looking at just _two_ menus. Slightly better! Haha, but it took a bit longer than in the States to decide.

In my family at home, my mom or dad usually picks out all the dishes at a restaurant. Then, they put the dishes in the middle, and we share everything "family style." That way, we only need one menu. It is the cultural norm here, which is probably why they didn't know we wanted more menus.

I'm picking up on subtleties I had always taken for granted!
